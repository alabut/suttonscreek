          <p class="lead">The focus of this first bit of work is to explore and research a few different avenues, both for the content <em>(via UX)</em> and overall vibe <em>(via visual&nbsp;design)</em>. </p>

          <h3>UX</h3>
          <p>Like I said on the phone, I'm fine with the overall structure of the existing site and the proposed wireframes, save for one exception: <strong>the home page is a bit dense for a visitor's initial impression,</strong> both for the live site and <a href="https://suttonscreek.mybalsamiq.com">the proposed Balsamiq wireframes</a>. The wireframes actually increase the level of information density by introducing carousels (horizontal rotating sections).</p>
          
          <p>All of the information and writing is useful, it just needs to be reformulated into <strong>a clear and strong visual hierarchy</strong> with one primary message and several supporting secondary ones, rather than having the eye bounce around and try to make sense of several things at once.</p>
          <p>This is especially important because the demographics of your audience will change to a more impatient one as your business grows, because instead of having only visitors that already know who you are, you'll shift to an increasing number that don't know much about you and arrived at the site via word of mouth, organic traffic, or upcoming SEO campaigns. Which means the website will need to make a stronger initial impression about what the company does.</p>
          <p>The two design tweaks I have in mind are to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>add a large showpiece banner that takes up most of the home page</strong>, to communicate exactly what the company does in an obvious and unambiguous way</li>
            <li><strong>add whitespace to the elements below the fold</strong> to make it easier to scan and give it the breathing room to be more readable.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Iâ€™ve had great results with this split approach to home pages - with a large minimal section up top and denser secondary information below. I have two recent examples of this strategy from my work at Zapier, a workflow automation app. I redesigned their home page and increased the signup conversion rate by 18% by adding a showpiece banner area to fill the initial browser screen and moving the supporting material down below the fold, and also created an annual report with the same principles and it resulted in a good amount of tweets and other buzz on social media.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Zapier home page: <a href="http://zapier.com">http://zapier.com</a></li>
            <li>Zapier annual report: <a href="http://zapier.com/2013">http://zapier.com/2013</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Also, the wireframes make liberal use of carousels, probably with the intention to solve the information density by focusing on one element at a time. Unfortunately, carousels have usability issues by hiding content and distracting the eye with animations. Carousels also tend not to perform very well - see the articles below for more data on conversion rates:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.bayesianwitch.com/blog/2014/carouselsarebadforconversions.html">http://www.bayesianwitch.com/blog/2014/carouselsarebadforconversions.html</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/">http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/</a></li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <p>So, with that in mind, I plan to create wireframes variations of the home page with greater whitespace, a home banner, and no carousels, if we're all on board with this approach.</p>
